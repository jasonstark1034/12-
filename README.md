  Recently,I'M really busy at math studying.Now it comes to indefinite integral，which is not easy to handle.There are loads of 
formulas need to be membered.okey,but my destination of writting this dairy is to illustrate my learning skill,because of writing
in english,which makes me feel kind of weird.
  Now,i'll officially state some detials,firstly,i always take notes to grasp my math knowledge well,also let me learn well about 
the inside logic structure of these formulas,the logic relationship of the math really matters.Besides,the practice of plenty math
  problems is neccessary.To be honest,in this uni,i can't get enough practice.So i am supposed to buy more papers and mathematic 
  analysis to improve my proficiency.For the future month,i would put more time to math.
  Then,it's about english learning,for such a long time i haven't patiently read some english books,recite words.The only conection
  with engish is english songs and films,buf it's not enough.The cet4 exam will come soon,the listening matching and translation 
  is not that easy,also,I need to recite some words becuase i feel i've forgot some words .What i need to do now is practice more 
  papers and be familiar with the types,keeping reciting the words.
    last,it's the study of programming，since i'm not a cs student,there will be less lessons about software in my majority.The most
  study lies on my hardworking.I plan to comcrete my comprehension of c languege in the winter holiday,which means i'll read the c 
  primer at that time.Additionally, i am trying to learn some skills about matlab and r language which helps a lot about mathamatic
  modeling,that's to say, i am eager to join the competition next year.
    Here is a conclusion,in such a bad enviroment,no one will reminds u to study hard to improve,but i must concentrate on my aim ,
    remind myself the disaters i've suffered,and never make the same mistakes in the future.Insist closing my aim step by step.
